# Password Generator 


## Description

Hello Everyone. Here is my work for the module three assignment. It was a bit of a challange but what I have done is written the code in JavaScript to make sure that
when you click the password generator, a series of prompts come up. Prompts that can dictate how long the password is, if there are upper or lower case letters, special characters
and numeric numbers. After pressing the button for a password, a random password is generated to you based on your criteria.
